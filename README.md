# Solix International — One‑Page Static Site (Polished, Balanced, and Stable)

This build delivers a visually balanced, fast, and accessible one‑pager with the header/hero shade eliminated, the logo hierarchy fixed, six Capabilities restored (2 × 3), and forms wired with EmailJS + graceful mailto fallback. Product cards now use real images (desktop thumbnails + larger mobile images).

1) Currently Completed Features (2025‑09‑30)
- Header/hero stability: solid white header, no blur/shade, hero never gets overlaid
- Logo hierarchy:
  - Desktop (PC): logo height locked at a stable 220px via CSS var --logo-desktop; header/hero spacing tied to max(header, logo) so no overlap
  - Mobile: header logo hidden; large optical‑centered hero logo shown and aligned via CSS variables (including X‑offset)
  - Fallback chain for header logo sources; icon‑only asset used for favicon
- Navigation reliability and accessibility:
  - Mobile compact popover (#mobile-popover) with aria-controls + aria-expanded, Escape closes, outside click/tap closes, icon toggles (bars ↔ xmark)
  - Native smooth anchor scrolling using CSS scroll-behavior + scroll-padding-top (no JS offsets)
- Hero composition & spacing:
  - Title: “Cement & Gypsum” in blue gradient; “Solutions” on its own line in orange
  - Two left‑aligned paragraphs separated by a subtle divider
  - Deterministic mobile spacing so both CTAs remain above the fold; short‑viewport rule hides the 2nd paragraph if needed
- Products: restored full column-width photos for Cement and Gypsum for stronger visual presence
- Contact: country flags added (UAE and Egypt) for more vivid, indicative headings
- Capabilities: swapped vector badges for photographic thumbnails (local images under images/thumbs) for a more editorial look
- Capabilities: 2 rows × 3 cards with explanatory text
- Quote and Contact sections visually balanced (max‑w‑6xl, consistent button styles)
- Back‑to‑top button with smooth scroll
- EmailJS integration (placeholders in code) with mailto fallback if keys aren’t set or network fails
- Typography: Inter + Playfair via Google Fonts; semantic HTML, accessible labels

2) Functional Entry URIs
- Sections (anchors): #home, #about, #products, #capabilities, #quote, #contact
- Header/navigation: #navbar; #mobile-menu-btn (aria-controls: mobile-popover); #mobile-popover; #mobile-backdrop
- Forms: #quote-form, #contact-form
- Success containers: #quote-success, #contact-success
- Scripts: js/main.js, js/utils.js
- Styles: css/style.css

3) Features Not Yet Implemented
- Live EmailJS keys/service/template IDs (placeholders used)
- Optional hover/beautification tweaks beyond the subtle defaults
- Analytics or authentication (intentionally omitted for a static site)

4) Recommended Next Steps
- Provide your EmailJS public key + service ID + template IDs and update js/main.js:
  - emailjs.init({ publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' })
  - emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_QUOTE_TEMPLATE_ID', params)
  - emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_CONTACT_TEMPLATE_ID', params)
- Desktop logo sizing options:
  - Keep stable: adjust --logo-desktop to your preferred pixel height (e.g., 180–220px)
  - Enable robust dynamic match to “Cement & Gypsum”: in js/utils.js set ENABLE_DYNAMIC_LOGO = true and tune MIN/MAX/SCALE; this waits for fonts and clamps to avoid the “tiny” regression
- If you have tighter‑cropped header assets, drop images/solix-logo-header.png — it’ll be auto‑preferred by the fallback chain
- Optional: increase card hover lift, add section dividers or button polish as desired

5) Project Name, Goals, and Main Features
- Name: Solix International — SGS Certified Cement & Gypsum
- Goal: Credible, conversion‑ready one‑pager with strong trust signals and easy lead capture
- Main features: fixed header with no overlay, strong hero, responsive layout, six Capabilities, two forms with EmailJS + mailto fallback, accessible mobile menu

6) Public URLs
- To deploy your website and make it live, please go to the Publish tab where you can publish your project with one click. The Publish tab will handle all deployment processes automatically and provide you with the live website URL.

7) Data Models, Structures, and Storage
- None. Pure static front‑end. Submissions go through EmailJS when configured, else fall back to mailto

Technical Highlights
- Header height and hero spacing use CSS variables and max(header, logo) so nothing overlaps or shades
- CSS variables:
  - Desktop: --header-desktop, --logo-desktop (now default 220px)
  - Mobile: --header-mobile-height, --logo-mobile, --logo-mobile-x
- CSS scroll-padding-top keeps anchor targets correct with a fixed header
- Mobile popover menu uses a transparent backdrop to capture outside taps without dimming the hero

Changelog (2025‑09‑30)
- Fixed the “tiny logo on PC” by disabling fragile runtime measurement; locked stable 220px and added an optional robust dynamic path (fonts.ready + clamps)
- Restored column-width product photos for Cement and Gypsum
- Replaced Capabilities icons with photographic thumbnails (local, cached images)
- Minor CSS improvements: reduced overly aggressive logo min-width to avoid layout strain; ensured hero overflow is visible
- Preserved all accessibility and reliability fixes (menu, Escape, outside click)
